# multi.s

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

multi.s is an upcoming package motivated for personal use. It is a wrapped around Daniel Parson's package, which can be found in this github repository: https://github.com/sdparsons/splithalf. 

Now, the package only have a function to compute the split-half of the difference in RT data. This function is expected to be improved with more possibilities: analysis of accuracy, apply specifications on raw data before computing split-half, tools for visualize and report results, and, of course, speeded multiverse analisys. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of multi.s running this code:

``` r
if(!require(remotes)){install.packages("remotes")}
remotes::install_github("franfrutos/multi.s")
```
